The Jones polynomial via Wilson loop is essentially obtained from Cayley-Hamilton's equation.
Let the trivial loop in 2+1 spacetime of a majorana zero mode be \\(d\\) then

\\[
d = \int \mathcal{D}a e^{iS_\mathrm{CS}[a]}W_{\gamma}[a].
\\]

Now for two majorana zero modes they could braid. Before they braid we pick a time slice and set it to \\(t=0\\). Then

\\[
\psi = \int \mathcal{D}a e^{iS_\mathrm{CS}[a]}W_{\gamma_-}W_{\gamma'_-}\exp\int_{-\infty}^0 \int d^2x \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CS}.
\\]

After the times \\(t=0\\) it braids to be \\(\chi\\). By drawing we find that

\\[
\langle \psi | \psi\rangle = d^2, \quad
\langle \psi | \sigma_i |\psi\rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_i^{-1} |\psi\rangle = d.
\\]
