The Jones polynomial via Wilson loop is essentially obtained from Cayley-Hamilton's equation.
Let the trivial loop in $2+1$ spacetime of a majorana zero mode be $d$ then
\[
d = \int \mathcal{D}a e^{iS_\mathrm{CS}[a]}W_{\gamma}[a].
\]
Now for two majorana zero modes they could braid. Before they braid we pick a time slice and set it to $t=0$. Then
\[
\psi = \int \mathcal{D}a e^{iS_\mathrm{CS}[a]}W_{\gamma_-}W_{\gamma'_-}\exp\int_{-\infty}^0 \int d^2x \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CS}
\]
