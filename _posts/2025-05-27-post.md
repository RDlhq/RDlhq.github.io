The Jones polynomial via Wilson loop is essentially obtained from Cayley-Hamilton's equation. We will work with SU(2)\\(_k\\) gauge group.
Let the trivial loop in 2+1 spacetime of a majorana zero mode be \\(d\\) then

\\[
d = \int \mathcal{D}a e^{iS_\mathrm{CS}[a]}W_{\gamma}[a].
\\]

Now for two majorana zero modes they could braid. Before they braid we pick a time slice and set it to \\(t=0\\). Then

\\[
\psi = \int \mathcal{D}a e^{iS[a]}W_{\gamma_-}W_{\gamma^\prime_-} \exp\left(\int_{-\infty}^0 dt \int d^2x \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CS}\right).
\\]

After the time \\(t=0\\) it braids to be, for example \\(\sigma_i\psi\\). By drawing we find that

\\[
\langle \psi | \psi\rangle = d^2, \quad
\langle \psi | \sigma_i |\psi\rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_i^{-1} |\psi\rangle = d.
\\]

Since $\sigma$ is a 2-by-2 matrix, it satisfies the Caylay-Hamilton's equation

\\[
\sigma - \mathrm{tr}\sigma + \det \sigma \cdot \sigma^{-1} = 0.
\\]

The eigenvalues are \\(R_1^{\sigma \sigma} = -q^{3/2}\\) and \\(R_\psi^{\sigma \sigma} = q^{-1/2}\\) where \\(q=-e^{-\pi i /2(k+2)}\\) then finally we obtain

\\[
q^{-1/2} \sigma_i - q^{1/2} \sigma_i^{-1} = q - q^{-1}
\\]

which is the skein relation of the Jones polynomial.
